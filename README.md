#Introduction to programming

These are the example programms I used to teach programming to math undergrads at [UADY](http://www.matematicas.uady.mx)


#Software

We used *python2.7*, and installed [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) as the recommended way to get a working distribution that included numerical routines and a plotting library.
